                        <h3>It's Importance</h3>
                        <p>Accessibility is a necessity in the web developing world. It broadens the
                            consumer umbrella to bring in new and reoccurring users. By aiding
                            websites with easier and quicker obtainability, we give users the
                            capability to reach the content they need. That’s why our main focus of
                            this project is to help the overall flow of the website, to make it more
                            effortless for everyone.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="flex-container" id="addImg">

                            <h3>How It's Shown in this Project</h3>
                            <p>Like we said in the <span class="bold"><a href="index.html">Home
                                        page</a></span>, we added many forms of interactivity to the
                                website. Even the Home page of the project has features that guide
                                the eyes to maintain interest. The Home page has a button to
                                automatically scroll you down to the project’s About section. In the
                                About section, there are many short clips that demonstrate the
                                passage next and below it, keeping the user’s interest by
                                visualizing the paragraphs. </p>
                            <p>In the <span class="bold"><a href="dictionary.html">Dictionary
                                        page</a></span>, we didn’t want to draw too much attention
                                away from the terms like in the original page, since its purpose is
                                to just define terms. To make things easier for those looking for
                                specific terms, we added the alphabetical filter. The filter’s main
                                objective is to shorten scrolling distance for those who have
                                limited mobility and those who need a quick search. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="right">
                            <figure id="insuranceClip">
                                <img src="multimedia/accessabilityImg.png"
                                    alt="Image of the universal handycapped symbol" />
                                <figcaption>
                                    <a id="access" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/">Image
                                        Link</a>
                                </figcaption>
                            </figure>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="ques">
                        <p>The <span class="bold"><a href="deductible.html">Deductible
                                page</a></span> is linked from the Dictionary page to provide
                            further information. This page really lacked interactive media. It is
                            also where we put more variety in our pursuit of accessibility. We first
                            added a progress bar that appears after the user starts to scroll, and
                            it stays at the top of the screen as it grows. That and the image placed
                            strategically lower than the users screen height will encourage the user
                            to scroll. Soon enough, the user will find a menu of closed drop-down
                            questions. If the user is interested, they have the option to reveal one
                            or more answers. This drop-down helps the page seem shorter for less
                            scrolling. The last thing on the Deductible page is the Related Topics
                            section we added, providing links to other topics the user might find
                            convenient.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the entire web project has a menu bar stuck to the top of the
                            screen that disappears when scrolling down, but then reappears when
                            scrolling up. The whole webpage also has paragraphs stretching the whole
                            width of the screen to minimize height. The Dictionary page is the only
                            exception in order to maintain the “quick and easy” feel to the
                            definitions. </p>
