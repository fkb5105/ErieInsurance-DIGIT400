                        <h3>What is a deductible?</h3>
                        <p>A deductible is what you pay out of pocket to fix your car before your
                            car insurance pays for the rest. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="ques" id="addedImg">
                        <div>
                            <h3>How does a deductible work?</h3>
                            <p>If you carry comprehensive and collision coverage on your car
                                insurance, you will see a deductible listed on your policy as a
                                dollar amount. When you file a claim, that's the amount you will pay
                                to fix your car before your insurance company kicks in with the
                                rest.</p>
                            <p>Let’s say your policy has a $500 deductible. Then one day, you run
                                into a tree and your car repair bill comes to $1,200. You would pay
                                $500 toward fixing your car, and your insurance pays the remaining
                                $700. </p>
                            <p>You’re probably already familiar with deductibles from your health
                                insurance policy, but it’s important to understand auto insurance
                                deductibles work a little differently. With auto insurance, you
                                don’t have to meet an annual deductible before insurance starts
                                covering your expenses; you would pay the deductible with each
                                claim. </p>

                        <h3>When do you pay your deductible?</h3>
                        <p>You only pay the deductible for repairs made to your own vehicle.
                            However, you don’t pay a deductible for other vehicles involved in the
                            collision, even if you are found at fault.</p>
                        <p>However, there are some exceptions to paying a deductible for damage to
                            your vehicle. If another driver is found at fault for the accident, then
                            their insurance company would pay for the damages and you will be
                            reimbursed for your deductible. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="ques">
                        <h3>Factors for choosing a deductible</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes, people opt for a higher deductible because there’s a tradeoff:
                            They pay less money for insurance premiums.</p>
                        <p>Alternatively, if you pay a higher deductible, you’re taking on some of
                            the financial risk if you get into a crash. The insurance company
                            recognizes this, so that's why your insurance premium is less.</p>
                        <p>But lower premiums do not necessarily make it a financially sound
                            decision. If you’re choosing between two car insurance plans, or you’re
                            just wondering if it makes sense to increase your deductible to save
                            money, these are some factors and considerations.</p>
                        <p></p>

                                <p>The premium savings is always nice to have. But ask yourself, if
                                    you had a car accident next week, would you have $1,000 in cash
                                    to pay your deductible? And how likely are you to have it next
                                    month? Three months from now? If this would send you deeper into
                                    debt, a lower deductible may be a safer financial choice. </p>

                                <p>If you’re choosing between two deductibles, do some quick
                                    calculations. How much will you save every year on premiums?
                                    Would these savings make a meaningful impact on your budget?
                                    This is where the value of your car can be a big factor. For
                                    example, newer vehicles are more expensive to replace than older
                                    vehicles. For that reason alone, you may see a big price jump in
                                    your premium if you go with the lower deductible. </p>

                                <p>No one plans on getting into a car accident. But if you’re still
                                    leaning toward a higher deductible, think about this: How long
                                    would it take to recoup what you’ll spend on premium costs? If
                                    it’s just going to take you a year or two, the higher deductible
                                    may still be looking good. Otherwise, the lower deductible may
                                    make more sense. </p>

                                <p>The insurance company has its own formula for calculating

                                    whether selecting the higher deductible is worth it. Think about
                                    how you use your car. Where do you live? Where do you drive to?
                                    Where do you park? If you live in a quiet community with a brief
                                    commute to work, you may be comfortable with a higher
                                    deductible. </p>
