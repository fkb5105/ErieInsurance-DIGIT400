                        <p>This Open Lab project between Erie Insurance and the DIGIT 400 class
                            consisted in redesigning an improved website structure to optimize
                            navigation and access to the insurance terms dictonary page.
                            Furthermore, we decided to improve the User Interface of the dictionary
                            page itself, and provided a prototype of a more efficient layout of an
                            insurance term page. The main idea behind these updates is to display
                            the content when the user demands it, instead of overwhelming the user
                            with text and information that is no use to them.</p>

                        <p>This website will guide you through the entire project and showcase all
                            our proposed changes and updates as well as comparisons between the
                            current design and the new one. This specific page serves as the
                            homepage, it gives an overview of the project and all of our changes,
                            and will also allow you to navigate throughout the project</p>

                                    <p>When we were going through the purpose of a page like the
                                        insurance dictionary, we concluded that all the term's
                                        definitions should be accessible everytime that specific
                                        term shows up in the website. Meaning that if a user is
                                        reading through their policy, they should be able, without
                                        leaving the page they are in, to learn what all the terms in
                                        their coverage mean. This is a subtle way of providing
                                        accessibility to the insurance dictionary page throughout
                                        the rest website.</p>

                                    <p>The second problem we noticed when we started this project is
                                        the actual accessibility of the insurance dictionary page.
                                        We realized that it wasn't anywhere on the website's menu,
                                        and if you looked for it in the search bar it wouldn't
                                        appear as well. The only way we found to access the
                                        dictionary page was by searching for a term, opening the
                                        term's page, and only then we found the 'Insurance
                                        Dictionary' link. This is an effort most users wouldn't be
                                        willing to go through and would most likely abandon the
                                        website.</p>

                            <p>Besides the accessibility and navigation updates for the insurance
                                dictionary page, we also decided to improve the user interface and
                                the interactivity of both the dictionary, and a specific term's
                                page. For the dictionary page we came up with a simple solution to
                                save the user time and effort of scrolling through the terms, by
                                adding an ABC filter at the top of the page. With this feature, the
                                user can easily find the term they are looking for by clicking the
                                first letter of their word on the filter. For the specific term page
                                we chose to redesign the <a
                                    href="https://www.erieinsurance.com/insurance-dictionary/deductible"
                                    >Deductible</a> page by adding interactive features like a read
                                more + button on the FAQ, a scroll progress bar, and a back to top
                                button. These changes make a more efficient and interactive layout
                                overall, which will therefore improve the user experience.</p>
